    <h2>My Life</h2>
    <p id="intro">My name is Nathan Le and I'm 23 years old.  I am an Asian American that lives in California.  I was born and raised in Orange County.</p>
    <p><span>I was always an active person growing up.</span>  I tried almost every sport.  My main sport is basketball.  I played it all four years in highschool. Luckily, both my siblings played basketball.  Which motivated me to be better. As of right now, my favorite hobby is golf.  I just started playing golf less than a month ago. When it comes to winter, it is a different story. Snowboarding is my main hobby.</p>
    <p>My life is very family and friend oriented. I have been with my girlfriend for almost 8 years. I started dating her when I was 15 years old. I am glad for my friends and family. They pushed me to be the person I am today.</p>
    <p>My life goal is to travel the world. Firstly, I would like to get career. Which is looking pretty solid right now because I am almost done with my bachelors. Secondly, make and save the most money I can. Once I am financially stable, I would start traveling the world. After I am done traveling, I would then find a house, buy a new car, and support my family.</p>
